## Back Fitting using R

Back Fitting is an approach used to do multiple linear regression. This is very helpful if the software at hand only does a regression with one variable.

The approach is based on a high number of iterations where the stop criterion is when values of the intercept for two consecutive iteration is the same.

The implementation of the function is done using the R language.

The function is supplied with the following two variables:
